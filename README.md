#PREDICTION OF STOCK PRICE USING NEURAL NETS. 
Predicting stock price using historical data of a company, using Neural networks (LSTM).

This project includes python programs to show Keras LSTM can be used to predict future stock prices for a company using it's
historical stock price data. 
You can also find sample programs on how to fine tune Hyperprameters of LSTM (or any Neural Network for that matter).

The model's accuracy could be improved further by playing around with the parameters more or using statistical analysis. 

#CAUTION
This model may be overfitting to datasets so, please be careful to change the parameters accordingly.
